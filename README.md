Distributed Systems API

This project involves creating a client-server application using ASP.NET Core Web API. 
The application provides various security and encryption services. 
The server handles multiple client requests and uses Entity Framework for database management. 
The client interacts with the server through defined API endpoints.

Handles multiple client requests simultaneously.
Uses Entity Framework to manage a local database of users.
Provides several endpoints for different functionalities, such as user management and encryption services.
Implements custom authentication and authorization using API keys.

Client-Side:
A console application that communicates with the server.
Supports various commands to interact with the server's API endpoints.
Asynchronous operations to improve user experience.
